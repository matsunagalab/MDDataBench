# Task 039_ligand_3ikd

Simulate Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1, PDB entry **3IKD**, chain **A** residues **51–163**, in explicit solvent.

- **Amber ff99SB-ILDN** protein force field, **TIP3P** water, neutralised
- **298 K**, **NPT** at **1 bar**
- at least **1 ns** of production MD

Simulate every ionisable side chain in its standard state at pH 7: charged aspartate, glutamate, lysine and arginine, and neutral histidine and cysteine.

Leave the prepared structure, the topology, the minimised state and the production
trajectory as artifacts. The evaluator recomputes everything it needs from them.
